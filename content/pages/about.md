> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well-usually programs they wrote themselves-and never study the great programs of history.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the AOSA essays very much. You should read them! However, there's something missing in those essays, and that is actual business problems. I spent a lot of time reading Michael Bayer's essay on [SQLAlchemy](https://www.aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html), but I could not see how it applied to my job as a software developer in a fintech startup. I knew *something* could be learnt, but it wasn't concrete enough for me to make the connection.

At first I thought it was just me, but soon enough I found that many of my peers did not have a good understanding of the business problems they were trying to solve with software, and were repeating "one another's mistakes", much like those to whom the authors of AOSA were addressing their writings.

It seems to me that the industry has already moved on to fancy solutions (blockchain, any?) without a careful study of how legacy financial technology has addressed business needs. Weirdly enough, the consequence of this is that the blockchain ecosystem is simply repeating the errors of the past rather than creating new, innovative solutions to current and future problems.

My goal is to help change that. I'm going to walk you through many interesting problems that pop up when trying to build fintech applications, those that support payments, investments, credit scores and more, and I aim at diving deep into potential solutions, the trade-offs involved, and unexplored avenues.

In doing so, I will do my best in instill you an ounce of respect for the technology of the past, while at the same time get you covered on many aspects of known solutions to business problems, so that we can "build on one another's successes".
